For the final experiment of this research paper, real time traffic data will be taken into account, simulating a 24-hour period of traffic. Using sources such as IDASO, a specialist traffic and mobility data provider, alongside data from the CSO, as well as news articles (\cite{McNamara_2023} \cite{ProjectAdmin_2021} \cite{Kelly_2021}), real time traffic data was now available to be utilised alongside the PPO algorithm which has now been fine-tuned after sensitivity analysis. IDASO provides both public and private data regarding road traffic, as well as mobility dashboards providing a multitude of information regarding mobility trends:

What these graphs provide is an overview for data concerned with road-traffic volumes and trends in Galway City. This data provides the foundation for the traffic volumes experienced within this experimentation. IDASO also provides a satellite view of Galway City, encompassing live traffic and sensors. Upon focusing in on this map, trends can begin to be spotted within the map, such as primary routes for road-traffic users within Galway City, detailing the main issues where dense traffic effects built-up environments. This data provided by IDASO allowed for the creation of SUMO route files for this experiments, indicating lanes which would be most densely populated with vehicles approaching a junction. The junction found in the suburban area of Newcastle in Galway City was prone to large traffic density, and the junction located closely to the Quincentennial Bridge and University of Galway was viewed as being prominent in terms of road-traffic density:

By using this road traffic data provided by IDASO, as well as the latest CSO data and information provided by articles related to vehicular traffic in Galway City, real-time road-traffic could be generated within SUMO for the purpose of this experiment. Vehicles were platooned on an hourly basis to closely represent the transition between average traffic and rush hour periods, similar to earlier experiments. Firstly however, it is important to view traditional traffic light systems over a 24-hour period:

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{PH5images/dayTime/trad/DayTradWait.png}
    \caption{Traditional 24-Hour Traffic: Total Waiting Time}
    \label{fig:trad24Wait}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\pagebreak

When viewing the traditional fixed traffic light system, waiting times over a 24-hour period follow a pattern which portray the stark reality of real time traffic. Throughout the first period of rush hour traffic (8am-10am), waiting times multiply threefold, and upon termination of this rush hour period, waiting times return to the same average as before this rush hour period. During the prime hours of traffic within this intersection, it can be seen that high waiting times are retained, and can be derived that speeds will be low throughout:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{PH5images/dayTime/trad/DayTradSpeed.png}
    \caption{Traditional 24-Hour Traffic: Mean Speed}
    \label{fig:trad24Speed}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}

As expected, mean speeds throughout the course of the simulation decrease throughout the daytime period, returning to higher speeds during nighttime. When realised on a real-time scale, high waiting times and low mean speeds over the course of 24-hours at an intersection highlight how the traditional fixed traffic light system is not capable of handling the high volume levels of traffic within cities. With this, the real-time air pollution levels should also follow the same pattern, as well as noise pollution and fuel consumption, further highlighting how QoL and emission levels can be improved within real-time traffic with the utilisation of PPO.

\pagebreak
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{PH5images/dayTime/trad/DayTradAir.png}
    \caption{Traditional 24-Hour Traffic: Air Pollution}
    \label{fig:trad24Air}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Data associated with air pollution further highlights how the combination of pollutants such as PM, CO, and NOx emissions are ever-present throughout a 24-hour period of road-traffic. Furthermore, these emissions grow almost four times during periods of high traffic volume, such as the beginning of a business work day, lunch time, and the end of the business work day. With this, it can be deemed that from 8am-6pm within a built-up environment with high traffic levels, traditional fixed traffic light systems and long waiting times result in huge figures related to air pollution. This prolonged time period showcases that air pollutants are strife within everyday traffic within cities. Ten hour periods of large air pollution figures on a daily basis show the underlying pattern of how traffic-related pollution is such a heavy contributor to environmental damage, global warming, and poor QoL within these urban environments.

    \label{fig:trad24Fuel}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}

In terms of QoL, both noise pollution and fuel consumption figures display concerning data for road-traffic users and residents within these built-up environments. The drastic information displayed between the hours of 8am-6pm show that fuel consumption figures and noise pollution are related to the direct effect of high waiting times and low mean speeds within this intersection. Considering that urbanisation is in a state of rapid incline, these QoL issues should be addressed in order to prevent issues surrounding QoL before they become national issues.

The data shown to this point will act as the control for this experiment. Considering the PPO algorithm which was found to be the most optimal DRL algorithm for UTM, and has also been fine-tuned using sensitivity analysis, PPO can be directly applied to this intersection with the same traffic volumes. What is expected, is a largely improved scenario around all of the aforementioned metrics. The most important metrics of course related to reducing air pollution and improving QoL is that of waiting times, and mean speeds within the intersection, as both metrics best display the mobility within the intersection, and will directly effect other data metrics of this experiment. By firstly decreasing waiting times and improving mean speeds, drastic improvements will be observed within other metrics, as proven earlier within other experiments. The data concerning waiting times and mean speeds with a PPO-oriented traffic light system can be viewed a such:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{PH5images/dayTime/ppo/DayPPOWait.png}
    \caption{PPO 24-Hour Traffic: Total Waiting Time}

    \caption{PPO 24-Hour Traffic: Mean Speed}
    \label{fig:ppo24Speed}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}

What is made evident by both graphs is that the refined PPO implementation has drastically improved both waiting times and mean speeds at this intersection when observed over a 24-hour period. Within the data concerned with waiting times, slight increases in waiting times can be observed during areas of the highest road-traffic volumes over the course of the simulation. Also, high concentrations of low waiting times are viewed throughout the simulation, importantly throughout the 10 hour period from 8am-6pm. When viewing the information made available with mean speeds, higher speeds are observed throughout the simulation. When compared to the control experiment, mean speeds are more optimal with this PPO implementation, and provides great insight into how the intersection's mobility has improved. PPO has proven to improve intersection mobility in terms of speed and waiting times over a 24-hour period, so it can be expected for air pollution figures to have also improved:

\pagebreak
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{PH5images/dayTime/ppo/DayPPOAir.png}
    \caption{PPO 24-Hour Traffic: Air Pollution}
    \label{fig:ppo24Air}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Immediately upon viewing this data, it becomes clear when rush hour periods of traffic occurred. This is due to the improved situation of decreased waiting times under this PPO implementation allowing for the backlog of traffic queues observed within the control experiment not existing here. By way of mitigating this backlog of traffic, air pollution figures have been drastically decreased due to less vehicles being present at the intersection. This can also be viewed as the improved reward function focusing on vehicles exiting the intersection taking effect and further improving this scenario over the 24-hour period. By way of improving the intersection's mobility and implementing a more optimal reward function, air pollution figures have successfully been decreased, providing an optimal DRL algorithmic implementation fro decreasing emissions.

\end{figure}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Similar to the data associated with air pollution, it is made evident within data concerned with QoL when high volumes of traffic were present at the intersection. Once again, the lack of a prolonged traffic queue has allowed for an optimal reduction in the observed data. Noise pollution has decreased due to the improved situation with waiting times, meaning that vehicles spend less time at the intersection, allowing for this reduction in noise. For fuel consumption, the increase in mean speeds can be deemed the primary contributor to this, as a smoother flow of traffic thought he intersection has meant that the road user can be more cost-effective with their vehicle's fuel.

To conclude this experiment, it has been proven that a traffic lights system which implements a PPO algorithm with a pressure-based reward function has outperformed the traditional fixed traffic light system, but also has been shown to effectively reduce emissions and improve QoL metrics. By experimenting with real-time traffic data, the inadequate situation surrounding the traditional fixed traffic lights system has been highlighted, allowing for improved UTM  with DRL implemented.
